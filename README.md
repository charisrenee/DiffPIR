# Leveraging Diffusion Models For Predominant Instrument Recognition

Coming Soon!

This repo contains the code for the experiments and dataset accompanying the [AI for Music Workshop](https://aiformusicworkshop.github.io/ "AI for Music Workshop") at NEURIPS 2025  paper "Leveraging Diffusion Models For Predominant Instrument Recognition" presented investigating the utility of features froma  pretrained diffusion model for the downstream task of PIR.

Audio examples are avaiable [here](https://bit.ly/DiffPIR-SoundExamples).
